# Chapter I: The Allure of the Ideal
## 1. Orienting to Utopia
### 1.1 Beyond the Contemporary Debate and Its Categories
> <em>We thus need to be cognizant of the current debates, while stepping back and keeping in mind that we are exploring a larger and mor enduring theme in political thinking.</em> - p.3
- Current debate is very complicated, but focusing on taxonomy prevents more systematic theorizing, which will have many interlocking parts that may be difficult to separate.
- Focusing too much on the modern debate risks ignoring an important tradition of thought that might provide relevant support or critique for a model or for categories of models.
- There is an important synthesis between utopian and ideal theories that if understood correctly will lead to a better understanding of why ideals are necessary and unify utopian-ideal theory.

### 1.2 Of Paradise
> <em>The ideal can orient us only if we have some idea of where it is, and where we presently are.</em> - p.4
- Ideals give us a destination to travel toward; progress happens through reforming social institutions in ways that better (if yet imperfectly) realize the ideal ends.
- The orienting function of ideals helps decide which possible reforms ought to be pursued and which issues ought to be prioritized
### 1.3 Climbing
> <em>[W]e may be willing to accept, with great certainty, thatn Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, completely unbeatable in terms of stature by any other peak, but that understanding is neither needed, nor pariticularly helpful, in comparing the heights of...Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount McKinley.</em> - p.6
- Ideal theories select reforms that move closer to the ideal point, while comparative theories rely on local improvements only.
- Comparative theories are attractive because they rely on direct judgements about improvements in justice without referring to a conception of perfect or ultimate justice
    - Judging which of two mountains is higher doesn't require any knowledge about Mt. Everest
- However, comparative theories are not guaranteed to move us closer to the true ideal, which makes our local judgements about improvements in justice problematic
    - If we want to get to the highest peak, we need to know to walk to the Himalayas, so global information is needed.
- If local comparisons are viewed as pairwise comparisons on complete transitive preference orderings, then every option lies on a one-dimension continuum of preference, so the maximally-preferred element (i.e., the one farthest to the right) can be attained through strictly pairwise comparisons.
    - Strictly speaking, Gaus's claim here is false. If (a < b) and (c < d), and every other pair of elements is incomparable, then you have a non-linear ordering that meets the definition of a complete transitive preference ordering.
- Two interpretations of comparitive theory:
    1. <em>(inherent binariness of judgments of justice)</em> Judgements about the relative justice of <em>a</em> vs. <em>b</em> are independent of (a) <em>any</em> third alternative; or (b) ideal justice in particular
        -  This is a theory about justice which holds that justice-making features of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> depend solely on their internal or relative features, and not on any internal or relative features of ideal justice

    2. <em>(ordering)</em> The final ordering of states-of-affairs will be linear, even if the justice-making features of each state-of-affairs are fundamentally relational with ideal justice
        - This theory permits relational information about ideal justice to be incorporated into the final ranking, while preserving the property that the ideal state-of-affairs can be reached through pairwise comparison

- Comparative theories (ala Sen) reject (2), but aren't necessarily committed to pure versions of (1); they need only hold that relational features are not _fundamental_ to a theory, and are of _little_ use (rather than _none whatsoever_) in weighing possible reforms

- Multidimensional theories hold that <em>a</em> may be an improvement to <em>b</em> along one dimension, but all-things-considered is farther away from the ideal <em>u</em>
    - For these theories, the location of <em>u</em> is important for measuring distances
