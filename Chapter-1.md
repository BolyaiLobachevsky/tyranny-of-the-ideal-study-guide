# Chapter I: The Allure of the Ideal
## 1. Orienting to Utopia
### 1.1 Beyond the Contemporary Debate and Its Categories
> <em>We thus need to be cognizant of the current debates, while stepping back and keeping in mind that we are exploring a larger and mor enduring theme in political thinking.</em> - p.3
- Current debate is very complicated, but focusing on taxonomy prevents more systematic theorizing, which will have many interlocking parts that may be difficult to separate.
- Focusing too much on the modern debate risks ignoring an important tradition of thought that might provide relevant support or critique for a model or for categories of models.
- There is an important synthesis between utopian and ideal theories that if understood correctly will lead to a better understanding of why ideals are necessary and unify utopian-ideal theory.

### 1.2 Of Paradise
> <em>The ideal can orient us only if we have some idea of where it is, and where we presently are.</em> - p.4
- Ideals give us a destination to travel toward; progress happens through reforming social institutions in ways that better (if yet imperfectly) realize the ideal ends.
- The orienting function of ideals helps decide which possible reforms ought to be pursued and which issues ought to be prioritized
### 1.3 Climbing
> <em>[W]e may be willing to accept, with great certainty, that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, completely unbeatable in terms of stature by any other peak, but that understanding is neither needed, nor pariticularly helpful, in comparing the heights of...Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount McKinley.</em> - p.6
- Ideal theories select reforms that move **closer to the ideal** point, while comparative theories rely on **local improvements** only.
- Comparative theories are attractive because they rely on direct judgements about improvements in justice without referring to a conception of perfect or ultimate justice
    - Judging which of two mountains is higher doesn't require any knowledge about Mt. Everest
- However, comparative theories are not guaranteed to move us closer to the true ideal, which makes our local judgements about improvements in justice problematic
    - If we want to get to the highest peak, we need to know to walk to the Himalayas, so global information is needed.
- If local comparisons are viewed as pairwise comparisons on complete transitive preference orderings, then every option lies on a **one-dimension continuum of preference**, so the maximally-preferred element (i.e., the one farthest to the right) can be attained through strictly pairwise comparisons.
    - <em>Strictly speaking, Gaus's claim here is false. If (a < b) and (c < d), and every other pair of elements is incomparable, then you have a non-linear ordering that meets the definition of a complete transitive preference ordering. -BL</em>
- Two interpretations of comparitive theory:
    1. **(inherent binariness of judgments of justice)** Judgements about the relative justice of <em>a</em> vs. <em>b</em> are independent of (a) <em>any</em> third alternative; or (b) ideal justice in particular
        -  This is a theory about justice which holds that justice-making features of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> depend solely on their internal or relative features, and not on any internal or relative features of ideal justice

    2. **(ordering)** The final ordering of states-of-affairs will be linear, even if the justice-making features of each state-of-affairs are fundamentally relational with ideal justice
        - This theory permits relational information about ideal justice to be incorporated into the final ranking, while preserving the property that the ideal state-of-affairs can be reached through pairwise comparison

- Comparative theories (ala Sen) reject **(ordering)** , but aren't necessarily committed to pure versions of **(inherent binariness of judgments of justice)**; they need only hold that relational features are not _fundamental_ to a theory, and are of _little_ use (rather than _none whatsoever_) in weighing possible reforms

- Multidimensional theories hold that <em>a</em> may be an improvement to <em>b</em> along one dimension, but all-things-considered is farther away from the ideal <em>u</em>
    - For these theories, the location of <em>u</em> is required for measuring distances

### 1.4 Dreaming
> <em>My chief concern is analyzing a class of ideal theories according to which the specification of an ideal <b>is</b> of critical importance in making relative judgments of justice and, in some way, of orienting practice.</em> - p.15

- Multidimensional concepts of justice face a computational challenge to account for both the justice of social states and their distance from the ideal social state. Some strategies:
    1. Don't measure distance from the ideal (Sen's solution)
    2. Don't measure justice of social states

- _Purely ideal_ concepts of justice may posit (a) attainable or unattainable goals; which are (b) related or unrelated to pursuing justice in nonideal social worlds. _Dreaming_ ideals are purely ideal concepts of justice which posit unattainable goals that are (or may be) unrelated to pursuing justice in nonideal settings.
    - Dreams of ideal justice may cause disorientation, hopelessness (although they may inspire hope as well), and are not action-guiding (on such a view, political philosophy is inert)
    - David Estlund proposes _hopeless realism_, a kind of dreaming ideal which posits realistic goals that are not and will never be attained. Further, ideal justice ought _not_ guide our actions, because trying to accomplish perfect justice may lead to worse outcomes than pursuing less-than-ideal but more-likely-to-succed courses of action. Lastly, ideals of justice may be true even if they have no practical value
- Our focus is on ideal theories that _are_ action-guiding and are important for making justice comparisons. Utopians need not believe that their theorizing is useless.

### 1.5 Recommending--Rescuing Justice from Uselessness
> <em>The orientation of **judgments** of justice cannot be the entire story; there must arrive a point at which a political philosophy concerned with justice yields recommendations about moving to more just social states. An ideal might be simply aspirational, but not the entire field of justice.</em> -p.17
- Non-dreaming ideal theories may fail to be action-guiding in the actual world, even if they correctly evaluate the justice of many social states. Such theories would fail to explain practices of justice: demanding, complaining, blaming, claiming, agitating, "the justice system", punishments, editorials, social movements, consciousness-raising, revolutions. Even Estlund's theory allows for "concessive" justice that deals with less-than-ideal justice.
- Action-guiding ideals need not be implementable, but they should be useful. Political philosophy should leverage judgments of justice to recommend actions that will improve justice conditions. 
    - These recommendations will rely on social and economic theory, political science, and psychology. Different contexts will require different toolkits, but empirical sciences will be consulted; it isn't enough to focus on justifying normative judgments.
        - <em>Aren't recommendations normative judgments? The "pure moral philosophy" vs. "recommendations based on empirical sciences" distinction seems ill-founded. - BL</em>
