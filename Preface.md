> <em>Only those in a morally heterogeneous society have a reasonable hope of actually understanding what an ideal society would be like, but in such a society we will never be collectively devoted to any single ideal.</em> - p.xix

## Modeling as a Method in Modern Political Philosophy

### History
- Modern political philosophers are focused on a narrow set of formal models.
    - Veil of ignorance, maximin
- Political philosophers have always used models, but have traditionally preferred informal and narrative models rather than formal or mathematical ones.
### Formal vs. Informal 
- Formalization helps with rigor, but informal and narrative models can be powerful (or weak, if unsupported).
- Formal and mathematical models of reasoning are important for handling complexity.
    - This will be used to show that Ideal theory has internal tensions or contradictions
- All models are simplifications of reality, but nevertheless generate understanding. Adding complexity and noting simplifying assumptions will help prevent overgeneralization.
- The content of this book is largely non-mathematical.

## Thesis: Homogeneity bad, Heterogeneity good

- Utopic visions of homogenous societies are misguided
- Heterogeneity is required for generating knowledge about ideal justice
- Heterogenous conceptions of justice have desirable features
    - Convergence re: moral responsibility
    - Information sharing
    - Security
    - Iron sharpens iron
